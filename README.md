## Inspiration  
As students, we know how hard it can be to stay motivated and focused on our goals. To get a sense of the challenges, I made a poll in a Discord server full of university students, and **70% of them felt that focusing and losing motivation was their biggest challenge**. Many students feel disconnected from their learning, and it’s tough to stay on track without a sense of achievement. **63% of students feel disengaged in school**, and that's a problem we wanted to solve. We created **DoraKingdom** to make learning fun, social, and rewarding, so students can stay motivated and connected while reaching their goals.

## What it does  
**DoraKingdom** is a **gamified platform** where students can:  
- **Set goals** and create personalized missions.  
- **Complete quests** with AI-generated tasks that guide them step by step.  
- **Earn badges** and **compete** on a leaderboard.  
- **Share** their progress and roadmaps with a community of learners.

We turn learning into a game, making it easier to stay motivated and achieve your goals while feeling part of a supportive community.

## How we built it  
We used:  
- **Next.js** for a fast, interactive website.  
- **Firebase** for user authentication and managing data.  
- **Gemini AI** to create personalized quests that help students complete their missions.  
It’s hosted on **Vercel** for seamless access, anytime.

## Challenges we ran into  
- **Making AI-generated quests meaningful**: We needed to ensure the tasks were practical and truly helped students achieve their goals.  
- **Balancing simplicity with fun**: Designing a platform that’s easy to use while keeping it engaging took time and effort.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of  
- Integrating **Gemini AI** to automate and personalize quests.  
- Creating a **community-driven platform** where students can learn and share.  
- Building a simple, fun, and effective way for students to set goals and track progress.

## What we learned  
We learned how powerful **gamification in education** can be in keeping students engaged. Making education social and rewarding really changes the way students approach learning.

---

## What's next for DoraKingdom  
- **Mobile app**: Making DoraKingdom even more accessible.  
- **Enhanced AI**: Offering deeper insights into students’ progress.  
- **New social features**: Adding community challenges and live chat.

**DoraKingdom** is here to make learning fun, social, and rewarding. We’re excited to help students reach their goals, together.
